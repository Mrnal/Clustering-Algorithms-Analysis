# Clustering-Algorithms-Analysis

This repository presents a systematic comparative analysis of clustering algorithms, evaluating K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering across three diverse, real-world datasets. The study explores how algorithm choice interacts with differences in feature distribution, data topology, and cluster structureâ€”offering actionable insights for practitioners selecting clustering techniques for heterogeneous data.
